# Biography

I am a Physicist, and recently a geoscientist expertising on numerical modelling. I create analytical and numerical models to understand how tectonic plates interact with the underlying mantle (asthenosphere), and how Earth's crust is recycled at subduction zones. I investigate the surface expression of mantle dynamics by using open-source code [Underworld](http://www.underworldcode.org/).
