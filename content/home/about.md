# Biography

I am a Physicist, and recently a Geoscientist expertising on numerical modelling of Earth's crust and mantle. I like to address the basic questions in Geodynamics that are governed by Newtonian Physics. I wish I could go down to quantum scale! As a first attempt, I do analytical calculations to get a sense of the simplest scenario, then at some point, I use numerical codes to solve quite complex interactions. For now, I spend most of my time trying to understand how tectonic plates interact with the underlying mantle (asthenosphere). I investigate the surface expression of mantle dynamics by using open-source code [Underworld](http://www.underworldcode.org/).
