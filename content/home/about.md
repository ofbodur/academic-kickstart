# AutoBiography

Welcome to my website!

I am a Physicist currently based in the largest island and smallest continent of the planet Earth, Australia. My expertise is mainly Geodynamics and I am currently busy with finishing my PhD in EarthByte Group at The University of Sydney. I will be moving to Wollongong as a post-doctoral research associate at The University of Wollongong.  

I am also very interested in Australian life, culture, environment and the history of formation of such a modern and very diverse nation.
