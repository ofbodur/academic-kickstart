## **Welcome!**

I am a Physicist and Geodynamicist based in Sydney, Australia. <br/>

I am currently busy with finishing my PhD in [EarthByte][EarthByteWebPage] Group at The University of Sydney. <br/>

In 2020, I will be moving to Wollongong to work as a post-doctoral research associate at The University of Wollongong.  <br/>  

See below for my research and other sharings.
