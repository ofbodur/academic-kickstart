## **Welcome!**

I am a Physicist currently based in the largest island and smallest continent, which is Australia. <br/>

My expertise is mainly Geodynamics and I am currently busy with finishing my PhD in [EarthByte][EarthByteWebPage] Group at The University of Sydney. <br/>

In 2020, I will be moving to Wollongong as a post-doctoral research associate at The University of Wollongong.  <br/>  

I am very interested in Australian life, culture, environment and the history of such a modern nation with high cultural diversity. <br/>


See below for my research, articles, posts and many others :)
