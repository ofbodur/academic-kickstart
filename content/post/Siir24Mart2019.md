### Siyah ve Beyaz
I feel that some sickness will find one of us <br/>
and will bring anything we left behind back to our eyes <br/>
I will be talking too much again on life's struggles <br/>
which will cement all the wholes between us, <br/>
Until no single air left between your eyes and my lips..

### Ã–mer F. Bodur
