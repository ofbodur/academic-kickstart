### Siyah ve Beyaz
I feel that some sickness will find one of us <br/>
and will bring anything we left behind back to our eyes <br/>
I will be talking too much again about us, <br/>
which will fill all the gaps between, <br/>
Like I clap my hands with a smile,
Or you pout your lips,
On which we can hang our coats.
We will hug each other so tightly,
As tight as a closed duck's beak,
Until no single air is left
between the past and our dreams.
### Ã–mer F. Bodur
