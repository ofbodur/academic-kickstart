### Duck's Beak
I feel that some sickness will find one of us <br/>
and will bring anything we left behind back to our eyes <br/>
I will be talking too much again about us, <br/>
which will fill all the gaps between, <br/>
Like I clap my hands with a smile,<br/>
Or you pout your lips,<br/>
On which we can hang our coats.<br/>
We will hug each other so tightly,<br/>
As tight as a closed duck's beak,<br/>
Until no single air is left<br/>
between the past and our dreams.<br/>
